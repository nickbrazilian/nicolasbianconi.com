# What is the Monero Contract System?

This is the idea of a web application written in rust making possible for anyone hosting their own escrow service website.

It is intended to use no javascript and to improve people freedom.

It is written in rust **actix** but i am open to build in any other rust framework, even other language.

This is the MVP: [Monero Contract System MVP](https://odysee.com/@nickbrazilian:b/monero-contracts-system:5)
