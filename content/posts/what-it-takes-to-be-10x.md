# **DISCLAIMER:** A Junior Developer's Aspiration

As a junior developer, I recognize I'm still early in my career. However, I'm driven to understand and pursue the path to becoming a 10x developer. Please consider this article as a reflection of my current understanding and a roadmap for my growth.

# Defining a 10x Developer

Imagine a project with 50,000 lines of code in an unfamiliar language. You're tasked with fixing a complex bug and implementing a new feature. A 10x developer tackles this challenge significantly faster and more effectively than the average developer, even with the initial learning curve.

# The Core Skill: Accelerated Learning

Ultimately, becoming a 10x developer hinges on your ability to rapidly learn and master new skills. This involves honing your problem-solving, creative, and cognitive abilities, akin to rigorous training.

**How to Train:**

* **Project-Based Learning:** Consistently create new projects and refine existing ones.
* **Continuous Improvement:** Focus on incremental progress and embrace challenges.

This journey requires time and dedication, especially when starting from a foundational level.

# Overcoming Perceived Limitations

While genetics and early exposure can play a role, they don't dictate your potential. Even renowned figures like Bobby Fischer and Mozart achieved mastery through intense dedication and what can be described as a "borderline obsession."

**The Power of Obsession:**

* For me, the driving force is the desire to secure a remote position with a competitive USD salary.
* Even with average intelligence, focused dedication and time can lead to exceptional results.

**Time Commitment:**

* It would take for me 2 years with 8 hours workday. **But this is not going to be 8 hours workdays**. 

# Conclusion

These are my current thoughts and aspirations on the path to becoming a 10x developer.

# Thank you for reading.
