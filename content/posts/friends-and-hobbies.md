# Sometimes you are better without any friends

If life was a videogame i would be still in the early game.

People in the early game are not worthwhile.

I had friends before but i completely cut ties with them since i stopped playing video games, eating junk food or going to young/teen parties. since these are harmfull activies that do not evoke anything good. Stopped talking to friends in the gym because i go to the gym to work out not talk.

I have people above me that mentor and help me, but i am not worthy of their friendship. They themselfes, for being people of high caliber, don't have any friends too, because they don't have time and rarely there is someone worth it.

# I don't have any hobbies, and am proud of it.

I would love to do activities like shooting, hunting, fighting, fishing, survival skills, raising animals and plants.

And i don't want to do these things for pleasure, i want to do these things because i am a survivalist. So i don't think it would be a hobby.

And even if i was to do these things for pleasure, how would i do that? I need money and freedom to do that. I don't have that. All my money and time goes to my gear, my servers, healthy food so i can achive freedom. 

I taking my money and time and doing anything else with it would be a cope.

# It is not going to be always like that.

One day i will have friends, work less like a maniac, but it is not today and won't be for a while.
