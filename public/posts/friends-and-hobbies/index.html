<p>If life was a videogame i would be still in the early game.</p>
<p>People in the early game are not worthwhile.</p>
<p>I had friends before but i completely cut ties with them since i stopped playing video games, eating junk food or going to young/teen parties. since these are harmfull activies that do not evoke anything good. Stopped talking to friends in the gym because i go to the gym to work out not talk.</p>
<p>I have people above me that mentor and help me, but i am not worthy of their friendship. They themselfes, for being people of high caliber, don&rsquo;t have any friends too, because they don&rsquo;t have time and rarely there is someone worth it.</p>
<p><strong>I am 43 and have no friends</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klephg-lCZc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klephg-lCZc</a></p>
<h1 id="i-dont-have-any-hobbies-and-am-proud-of-it">I don&rsquo;t have any hobbies, and am proud of it.</h1>
<p>I would love to do activities like shooting, hunting, fighting, fishing, survival skills, raising animals and plants.</p>
<p>And i don&rsquo;t want to do these things for pleasure, i want to do these things because i am a survivalist. So i don&rsquo;t think it would be a hobby.</p>
<p>And even if i was to do these things for pleasure, how would i do that? I need money and freedom to do that. I don&rsquo;t have that. All my money and time goes to my gear, my servers, healthy food so i can achive freedom.</p>
<p>I taking my money and time and doing anything else with it would be a cope.</p>
<h1 id="it-is-not-going-to-be-always-like-that">It is not going to be always like that.</h1>
<p>One day i will have friends, work less like a maniac, but it is not today and won&rsquo;t be for a while.</p>
