      <description>Sometimes you are better without any friends If life was a videogame i would be still in the early game.&#xA;People in the early game are not worthwhile.&#xA;I had friends before but i completely cut ties with them since i stopped playing video games, eating junk food or going to young/teen parties. since these are harmfull activies that do evoke anything good. Stopped talking to friends in the gym because i go to the gym to work out not talk.</description>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: A Junior Developer&amp;rsquo;s Aspiration As a junior developer, I recognize I&amp;rsquo;m still early in my career. However, I&amp;rsquo;m driven to understand and pursue the path to becoming a 10x developer. Please consider this article as a reflection of my current understanding and a roadmap for my growth.&#xA;Defining a 10x Developer Imagine a project with 50,000 lines of code in an unfamiliar language. You&amp;rsquo;re tasked with fixing a complex bug and implementing a new feature.</description>
