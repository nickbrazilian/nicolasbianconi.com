      <description>Sometimes you are better without any friends If life was a videogame i would be still in the early game.&#xA;People in the early game are not worthwhile.&#xA;I had friends before but i completely cut ties with them since i stopped playing video games, eating junk food or going to young/teen parties. since these are harmfull activies that do not evoke anything good. Stopped talking to friends in the gym because i go to the gym to work out not talk.</description>
